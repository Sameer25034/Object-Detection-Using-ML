🧠 Object Detection Web App
Welcome to the Object Detection Web App! This project leverages deep learning models to perform real-time object detection in images and videos. It offers a clean and intuitive web interface powered by Streamlit.

🚀 Features
🔍 Web-based object detection via a modern interface

🧠 Supports multiple object categories using pre-trained models

📸 Live camera and image upload functionality

⚡ Fast and efficient inference with PyTorch and OpenCV

👨‍💻 User-friendly interface for ease of use

🖥️ Demo
Image Upload Detection	Real-Time Camera Feed

📷 Screenshots of object detection results using uploaded image and webcam feed.

🛠️ Installation
